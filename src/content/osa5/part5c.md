<div class="content">

There are many different ways of testing React applications. Let's take a look at them next.

Tests will be implemented with the same [Jest](http://jestjs.io/) testing library developed by Facebook that was used in the previous part. Jest is actually configured by default to applications created with create-react-app.

In addition to Jest, we also need another testing library that will help us render components for testing purposes. The best option for this used to be the [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) library developed by AirBnB. Unfortunately Enzyme does not support React hooks properly, so we will instead use [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) which has seen a rapid growth in popularity in recent times.

Let's install the library with the command:

```js
npm install --save-dev react-testing-library jest-dom
```

Let's first write tests for the component that is responsible for rendering a note:

```js
const Note = ({ note, toggleImportance }) => {
  const label = note.important
    ? 'make not important'
    : 'make important'

  return (
    <li className='note'> // highlight-line
      {note.content}
      <button onClick={toggleImportance}>{label}</button>
    </li>
  )
}
```

Notice that the <i>li</i> element has the [CSS](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#classname) classname <i>note</i>, that is used to access the component in our tests.

### Rendering the component for tests

We will write our test in the <i>src/components/Note.test.js</i> file, which is in the same directory as the component itself.

The first test verifies that the component renders the contents of the note:

```js
import React from 'react'
import 'jest-dom/extend-expect'
import { render, cleanup } from 'react-testing-library'
import Note from './Note'

afterEach(cleanup)

test('renders content', () => {
  const note = {
    content: 'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä',
    important: true
  }

  const component = render(
    <Note note={note} />
  )

  expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent(
    'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä'
  )
})
```

After the initial configuration, the test renders the component with the [render](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#render) method provided by the react-testing-library:

```js
const component = render(
  <Note note={note} />
)
```

Normally React components are rendered to the <i>DOM</i>. The render method we used renders the components in a format that is suitable for tests without rendering them to the DOM.

_render_ returns an object that has several properties. One of the properties is called <i>container</i> and it contains all of the HTML rendered by the component.

In the expectation we verify that the component renders the correct text, which in this case is the content of the note:

```js
expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent(
  'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä'
)
```

### Running tests

Create-react-app configures the tests to be run in watch mode by default, which means that the _npm test_ command will not exit once the tests have finished, and will instead wait for changes to be made to the code. Once new changes to the code are saved, the tests are executed automatically after which Jest goes back to waiting for new changes to be made.

If you want to run tests "normally", you can do so with the command:

```js
CI=true npm test
```

**NB:** the console may issue a warning if you have not installed Watchman. Watchman is an application developed by Facebook that watches for changes that are made to files. The program speeds up the execution of tests and at least starting from macOS Sierra, running tests in watch mode issues some warnings to the console, that can be gotten rid of by installing Watchman.

Instructions for installing Watchman on different operating systems can be found from the official Watchman website: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/

### Test file location

In React there are (at least) [two different conventions](https://medium.com/@JeffLombardJr/organizing-tests-in-jest-17fc431ff850) for test file location. We created our test files according to the current standard by placing them in the same directory as the component being tested.

The other convention is to store the test files "normally" in their own separate directory. Whichever convention we choose, it is almost guaranteed to be wrong according to someone's opinion.

Personally, I do not like this way of storing tests and application code in the same directory. The reason we choose to follow this convention is because it is configured by default in applications created by create-react-app.

### Searching for content in a component

The react-testing-library package offers many different ways for investigating the content of the component being tested. Let's expand our test slightly:

```js
test('renders content', () => {
  const note = {
    content: 'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä',
    important: true
  }

  const component = render(
    <Note note={note} />
  )

  // tapa 1
  expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent(
    'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä'
  )

  // tapa 2
  const element = component.getByText('Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä')
  expect(element).toBeDefined()

  // tapa 3
  const div = component.container.querySelector('.note')
  expect(div).toHaveTextContent(
    'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä'
  )
})
```

The first way searches for a matching text from the entire HTML code rendered by the component.

The second way uses the [getByText](https://testing-library.com/docs/api-queries#getbytext) method of the object returned by the render method. The method returns the element that contains the given text. An exception occurs if no such element exists. For this reason we would technically not need to specify any additional expectation.

The third way is to search for a specific element that is rendered by the component with the [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) method that receives a [CSS-selektorin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) as its parameter.

### Debugging tests

We typically run into many different kinds of problems when writing our tests.

The object returned by the render method has a [debug](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#debug) method that can be used to print the HTML rendered by the component to the console. Let's try this out by making the following changes to our code:

```js
test('renders content', () => {
  const note = {
    content: 'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä',
    important: true
  }

  const component = render(
    <Note note={note} />
  )

  component.debug() // highlight-line

  // ...
})
```

We can see the HTML generated by the component in the console:

```js
console.log node_modules/react-testing-library/dist/index.js:64
  <body>
    <div>
      <li
        class="note"
      >
        Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä
        <button>
          make not important
        </button>
      </li>
    </div>
  </body>
```

It is also possible to search for a smaller part of the component and print its HTML code. In order to do this we need the _prettyDOM_ method, that can be imported from the <i>dom-testing-library</i> package that is automatically installed with react-testing-library:

```js
import React from 'react'
import 'jest-dom/extend-expect'
import { render, cleanup } from 'react-testing-library'
import { prettyDOM } from 'dom-testing-library' // highlight-line
import Note from './Note'

test('renders content', () => {
  const note = {
    content: 'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä',
    important: true
  }

  const component = render(
    <Note note={note} />
  )
  const li = component.container.querySelector('li')
  
  console.log(prettyDOM(li)) // highlight-line
})
```

We used the selector to find the <i>li</i> element inside of the component, and printed its HTML to the console:

```js
console.log src/components/Note.test.js:38
  <li
    class="note"
  >
    Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu react-testing-library:llä
    <button>
      make not important
    </button>
  </li>
```

### setup

The manual for the react-testing-library recommends to call the [cleanup](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#cleanup) method after every test. We can accomplish with the [afterEach](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown) function, that calls the method:

```js 
import React from 'react'
import 'jest-dom/extend-expect' // highlight-line
import { render, cleanup } from 'react-testing-library'
import { prettyDOM } from 'dom-testing-library'
import Note from './Note'

afterEach(cleanup)  // highlight-line
```

We could repeat the same cleanup in all of our test files. A better option is to [configure](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup) the cleanup to be done automatically. Let's create a new <i>src/setupTests.js</i> file for this configuration with the following contents:

```js
import 'jest-dom/extend-expect'
import 'react-testing-library/cleanup-after-each'
```

Now we can get rid of both of the highlighted rows of the test code.

**NB** if the configuration defined in the <i>src/setupTests.js</i> file is not used when the tests are run, it may help to add the following configuration to the <i>package.json</i> file:

```
  "jest": {
    ...
    "setupFiles": [
      "<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js"
    ],
    ...
  }
```

### Clicking buttons in tests

In addition to displaying content, the <i>Note</i> component also makes sure that when the button associated to the note is pressed, the _toggleImportance_ event handler functions gets called.

Testing this functionality can be accomplished like this:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library' // highlight-line
import { prettyDOM } from 'dom-testing-library' 
import Note from './Note'

// ...

it('clicking the button calls event handler once', async () => {
  const note = {
    content: 'Komponenttitestaus tapahtuu jestillä ja enzymellä',
    important: true
  }

  const mockHandler = jest.fn()

  const { getByText } = render(
    <Note note={note} toggleImportance={mockHandler} />
  )

  const button = getByText('make not important')
  fireEvent.click(button)

  expect(mockHandler.mock.calls.length).toBe(1)
})
```

There's a few interesting things related to this test. The event handler is [mock](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/mock-functions.html) function defined with Jest:

```js
const mockHandler = jest.fn()
```

The test finds the button <i>based on the text</i> from the rendered component and clicks the element:

```js
const button = getByText('make not important')
fireEvent.click(button)
```

Clicking happens with the [fireEvent](https://testing-library.com/docs/api-events#fireevent) method.

The expectation of the test verifies that the <i>mock function</i> has been called exactly once.

```js
expect(mockHandler.mock.calls.length).toBe(1)
```

[Mock objects and functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) are commonly used stub components in testing, that are used for replacing dependencies of the components being tested. Mocks make it possible to return hardcoded responses, and to verify the amount of times the mock functions are called and with what parameters.

In our example the mock function is a perfect choice, since it can be easily used for verifying that the method gets called exactly once.

### Tests for the <i>Togglable</i> component

Let's write a few tests for the <i>Togglable</i> component. Let's add the <i>togglableContent</i> CSS classname to the div that returns the child components.

```js
const Togglable = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={hideWhenVisible}>
        <button onClick={toggleVisibility}>
          {props.buttonLabel}
        </button>
      </div>
      <div style={showWhenVisible} className="togglableContent"> // highlight-line
        {props.children}
        <button onClick={toggleVisibility}>cancel</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
})
```

The tests are shown below:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library'
import Togglable from './Togglable'

describe('<Togglable />', () => {
  let component

  beforeEach(() => {
    component = render(
      <Togglable buttonLabel="show...">
        <div className="testDiv" />
      </Togglable>
    )
  })

  it('renders its children', () => {
    component.container.querySelector('.testDiv')
  })

  it('at start the children are not displayed', () => {
    const div = component.container.querySelector('.togglableContent')

    expect(div).toHaveStyle('display: none')
  })

  it('after clicking the button, children are displayed', () => {
    const button = component.getByText('show...')
    fireEvent.click(button)

    const div = component.container.querySelector('.togglableContent')
    expect(div).not.toHaveStyle('display: none')
  })

})
```

The _beforeEach_ function gets called before each test, which then renders the <i>Togglable</i> component into the _component_ variable 

The first test verifies that the <i>Togglable</i> component renders its child component `<div className="testDiv" />`.

The remaining tests use the [toHaveStyle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-dom#tohavestyle) method to verify that the child component of the <i>Togglable</i> component is not visible initially, by checking that the style of the <i>div</i> element contains `{ display: 'none' }`. Another test verifies that when the button is pressed the component is visible, meaning that the style for hiding the component <i>is no longer</i> assigned to the component.

The button is searched for once again based on the text that it contains. The button could have been located also with the help of a CSS selector:

```js
const button = component.container.querySelector('button')
```

The component contains two buttons but since [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector) returns the <i>first</i> matching button, we happen to get the button that we wanted.

Let's also add a test that can be used to verify that the visible content can be hidden by clicking the second button of the component:

```js
it('toggled content can be closed', () => {
  const button = component.querySelector('button')
  fireEvent.click(button)

  const closeButton = component.container.querySelector('button:nth-child(2)')
  fireEvent.click(closeButton)

  const div = component.container.querySelector('.togglableContent')
  expect(div).toHaveStyle('display: none')
})
```

We defined a selector that returns the second button `button:nth-child(2)`. It's not a wise move to depend on the order of the buttons in the component, and it is recommended to find the elements based on their text:

```js
it('toggled content can be closed', () => {
  const button = component.getByText('show...')
  fireEvent.click(button)

  const closeButton = component.getByText('cancel')
  fireEvent.click(closeButton)

  const div = component.container.querySelector('.togglableContent')
  expect(div).toHaveStyle('display: none')
})
```

The _getByText_ method that we used, is just one of the many [queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/api-queries#queries) <i>react-testing-library</i> offers.

You can find the code for our current application in its entirety in the <i>part5-7</i> branch of [this github repository](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2019/part2-notes/tree/part5-7).

### Exercises

#### 5.13: Blog list tests, step1

Add the following component temporarily to your application:

```js
import React from 'react'

const SimpleBlog = ({ blog, onClick }) => (
  <div>
    <div>
      {blog.title} {blog.author}
    </div>
    <div>
      blog has {blog.likes} likes
      <button onClick={onClick}>like</button>
    </div>
  </div>
)

export default SimpleBlog
```

Write a test that verifies that the component renders the title, author and amount of likes for the blog post.

If necessary, add CSS classes to the component for making testing easier.

#### 4.14: Blog list tests, step2

Write a test that verifies that if the <i>like</i> button of a component is pressed twice, the event handler function passed in the component's props is called twice.

#### 5.15*: Blog list tests, step3

Write tests for the <i>Blog</i> component of your application, that verify that by default only the name and author of the blog post is shown. Also verify that when the blog post is clicked, the other information of the blog post become visible.

<div class="content">

### Testing forms

In the previous tests we used the [fireEvent](https://testing-library.com/docs/api-events#fireevent) function for clicking buttons:

```js
const button = component.getByText('show...')
fireEvent.click(button)
```

In practice we created used <i>fireEventin</i> to create a <i>click</i> event for the button component. We can also use <i>fireEvent</i>  to simulate filling in forms.

Let's write a test for the <i>NoteForm</i> component. The code for the form looks like this:

```js
const NoteForm = ({ onSubmit, handleChange, value }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Luo uusi muistiinpano</h2>

      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
        <input
          value={value}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <button type="submit">tallenna</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The operating principle of the form is to synchronize the state of the input with the state of its parent React component. It is quite difficult to test the form on its own.

For this reason we will create a helper <i>Wrapper</i> component that renders the <i>NoteForm</i> and manages its state with the <i>state</i> prop that it receives:

```js
const Wrapper = (props) => {

  const onChange = (event) => {
    props.state.value = event.target.value
  }

  return (
    <NoteForm
      value={props.state.value}
      onSubmit={props.onSubmit}
      handleChange={onChange}
    />
  )
} 

```

Our test is as follows:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library'
import NoteForm from './NoteForm'

const Wrapper = (props) => {
  // ...
}

test('<NoteForm /> updates parent state and calls onSubmit', () => {
  const onSubmit = jest.fn()
  const state = {
    value: ''
  }

  const component = render(
    <Wrapper onSubmit={onSubmit} state={state} />
  )

  const input = component.container.querySelector('input')
  const form = component.container.querySelector('form')

  fireEvent.change(input, { target: { value: 'lomakkeiden testaus on hankalaa' } })
  fireEvent.submit(form)

  expect(onSubmit.mock.calls.length).toBe(1)
  expect(state.value).toBe('lomakkeiden testaus on hankalaa')  
})
```

The test creates a <i>Wrapper</i> component that is passed an _onSubmit_ mock function and a <i>state</i> object for representing the state.

The wrapper passes the function on to the <i>NoteForm</i> as its <i>onSubmit</i> event handler, and the the <i>value</i> property of the <i>state</i> prop as the value of the <i>input</i> element.

We simulate writing text into the <i>input</i> element by creating a <i>change</i> event for the input, and by defining a suitable object that defines the content we want to write.

The form is submitted by simulating a <i>submit</i> event for the form.

The first expect of the test verifies that submitting the form results in a call to the event handler. The second expect inspects the <i>state</i> object that was passed to the <i>Wrapper</i> component, and verifies that the value that was written in the input is reflected in the state.

### Frontend integration tests

In the previous part of the course material, we wrote integration tests for the backend that tested its logic and connected database through the API provided by the backend. When writing these tests we made the conscious decision not to write unit tests, as the code for that backend is fairly simple, and it is likely that bugs in our application occur in more complicated scenarios that integration tests are well suited for.

So far all of our tests for the frontend have been unit tests that have validated the correct functioning of individual components. Unit testing is useful at times but even a comprehensive suite of unit tests is not enough to validate that the application works as a whole.

Next let's write a single integration test for the application. Writing integration tests is considerably more difficult than writing unit tests for individual components. There are two challenges specific to our application: the application fetches the notes from the backend <i>and</i> the application uses local storage for storing information about the user who is logged in.

Local storage is not available to our tests by default, as it is functionality provided by the browser and our tests are not running in the browser. It is quite easy to overcome this challenge by defining a <i>mock</i> that mimics the functionality of the local storage. There are  [many](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32911630/how-do-i-deal-with-localstorage-in-jest-tests) ways to accomplish this.

As our tests do not rely on any actual local storage functionality, we will write a very simple mock in the [src/setupTests.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/ed5c48c81b2139b4414810e1efe917e04c96ee8d/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#initializing-test-environment) file:

```js
let savedItems = {}

const localStorageMock = {
  setItem: (key, item) => {
    savedItems[key] = item
  },
  getItem: (key) => savedItems[key],
  clear: savedItems = {}
}

window.localStorage = localStorageMock
```

Our second challenge is that the application fetches its notes from the server. Fetching the notes happens immediately after the <i>App</i> component is created in the effect hook:


```js
const App = () => {
  // ...

  useEffect(() => {
    noteService
      .getAll().then(initialNotes => {
        setNotes(initialNotes)
      })
  }, [])

// ...
}
```

The [manual mock](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/manual-mocks.html#content) concept from Jest provides us with a good solution. With manual mocks we can replace an entire module like _noteService_ with an alternative module that can mock the functionality of the module e.g. by returning hardcoded data. 

We follow the instructions provided by Jest and create a <i>\_\_mocks\_\_</i> subdirectory under the <i>src/services</i> directory, and inside the directory we create a new <i>notes.js</i> file that defines a <i>getAll</i> function that returns a hardcoded list of notes:

```js
const notes = [
  {
    id: "5a451df7571c224a31b5c8ce",
    content: "HTML on helppoa",
    date: "2019-01-28T16:38:15.541Z",
    important: false,
    user: {
      _id: "5a437a9e514ab7f168ddf138",
      username: "mluukkai",
      name: "Matti Luukkainen"
    }
  },
  {
    id: "5a451e21e0b8b04a45638211",
    content: "Selain pystyy suorittamaan vain javascriptiä",
    date: "2019-01-28T16:38:57.694Z",
    important: true,
    user: {
      _id: "5a437a9e514ab7f168ddf138",
      username: "mluukkai",
      name: "Matti Luukkainen"
    }
  },
  {
    id: "5a451e30b5ffd44a58fa79ab",
    content: "HTTP-protokollan tärkeimmät metodit ovat GET ja POST",
    date: "2019-01-28T16:39:12.713Z",
    important: true,
    user: {
      _id: "5a437a9e514ab7f168ddf138",
      username: "mluukkai",
      name: "Matti Luukkainen"
    }
  }
]

const getAll = () => {
  return Promise.resolve(notes)
}

export default { getAll }
```

The _getAll_ function returns a list of notes wrapped inside of a promise with the [Promise.resolve](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve) method. This is done because our application expects a promise when it uses the method.

We are ready to write our test. Since this test deals with the entire application, we will write our test in a new <i>App.test.js</i> file:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render,  waitForElement } from 'react-testing-library'
jest.mock('./services/notes')
import App from './App'

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('renders all notes it gets from backend', async () => {
    const component = render(
      <App />
    )
    component.rerender(<App />)
    await waitForElement(
      () => component.container.querySelector('.note')
    )

    const notes = component.container.querySelectorAll('.note')
    expect(notes.length).toBe(3) 

    expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent(
      'HTML on helppoa'
    )
    expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent(
      'Selain pystyy suorittamaan vain javascriptiä'
    )
    expect(component.container).toHaveTextContent(
      'HTTP-protokollan tärkeimmät metodit ovat GET ja POST'
    )
  })
})
```

The <i>jest.mock('./services/notes')</i> command takes our mock into use in the test. Perhaps a more logical place for this command would be in the <i>src/setupTests.js</i> file that configures our tests.

The test start by re-rendering the component `component.rerender(<App />)`, this is done to ensure that all of the effects are executed. It is possible that this command is no longer necessary with newer versions of React.

Since the action for fetching notes from the server is an [asynchronous](https://testing-library.com/docs/api-async) event, we use the [waitForElement](https://testing-library.com/docs/api-async#waitforelement) function for verifying that the <i>App</i> component renders all of the notes.

```js
await waitForElement(() => component.container.querySelector('.note'))
```

After this we implement the actual expect validations for the test, by verifying that the application has three elements that contain the CSS classname <i>note</i>, and that the content of each note is rendered.

### Test coverage

[The test coverage](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/ed5c48c81b2139b4414810e1efe917e04c96ee8d/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#coverage-reporting) of our suite of tests is easy to discover by running the tests with the following command:

```js
CI=true npm test -- --coverage
```

![](../../images/5/18.png)

The result is a fairly primitive HTML report that gets generated inside of the <i>coverage/lcov-report</i> directory. The HTML report tells us the untested lines of code in a component:

![](../../images/5/19.png)

As we can see, there is a lot of room for improvement.

You can find the code for our current application in its entirety in the <i>part5-8</i> branch of [this github repository](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2019/part2-notes/tree/part5-8).

#### 5.16*: Blog list tests, step4

Write an integration test for your application that verifies that if the user is not logged into the application, the application only displays a login form and no blogs are rendered.

The test can wait for the content of the component to render with the _waitForElement_ function.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { 
  render, waitForElement 
} from 'react-testing-library' // highlight-line
jest.mock('./services/blogs')
import App from './App'

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('if no user logged, notes are not rendered', async () => {
    const component = render(
      <App />
    )
    component.rerender(<App />)

// highlight-start
    await waitForElement(
      () => component.getByText('kirjaudu')
    ) 
    // highlight-end

    // expectations here
  })
})
```

**WARNING** when I was piloting this exercise, there was occasional instability related to _waitForElement_ or any other method intended for waiting for asynchronous operations to finish.

#### 5.17*: Blog list tests, step5

Writer another test that verifies that when the user is logged in, the blog posts are rendered to the page.

**Hint:*

Logging in is best to implement by mocking and manipulating local storage in the tests. If you define a mocked local storage for the tests according to the instructions, you can then use it in your tests like this:

```js
const user = {
  username: 'tester',
  token: '1231231214',
  name: 'Teuvo Testaaja'
}

localStorage.setItem('loggedBlogAppUser', JSON.stringify(user))
```

### Snapshot testing

Jest offers a completely different alternative to "traditional" testing called [snapshot](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html) testing. The interesting feature of snapshot testing is that developers do not need to define any tests themselves, it is simply enough to adopt snapshot testing. 

The fundamental principle is to compare the HTML code defined by the component after it has changed to the HTML code that existed before it was changed.

If the snapshot notices some change in the HTML defined by the component, then either it is new functionality or a "bug" caused by the accident. Snapshot tests notify the developer if the HTML code of the component changes. The developer has to tell Jest if the change was desired or undesired. If the change to the HTML code is unexpected it strongly implicates a bug, and developer can become aware of these potential issues easily thanks to snapshot testing.

### End to end tests

We have written integration tests for testing the entire component for both the frontend and the backend. We have not yet taken a look at another important category of tests, that test [the entire system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing) with "end to end" (E2E) tests.

The E2E testing of web applications happens by simulating a browser with a library like [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org). Another alternative is to use a so-called [headless browseria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser), that is a browser without a graphical user interface. It's even possible to use Chrome in Headless mode.

End to end tests have the potential to be the most valuable category of tests, as they inspect the application through the same interface as real end users.

There are also challenging aspects related to E2E tests. Configuring them is a lot more challenging than configuring unit and integration tests. E2E tests also tend to be quite slow to run, and in a larger application their execution time can range from minutes up to hours. This is unfortunate for application development, as it is extremely useful to be able to run tests as often as possible in order to catch any possible regressions quickly.

We will return to the topic of end to end testing in the final part of the course material.
